        <div><p>British people pay most attention to eating at Christmas, including roast pigs, turkey, Christmas pudding, Christmas minced meat pie and so on. 
        Every family has gifts, and every servant has gifts. All gifts are sent on Christmas morning. Some Christmas singers sing good news door by door. 
        They will be invited into the house by their owners, entertained with tea, or give small gifts.</p></div>

        <div><p>Because the United States is a country of many nationalities,
         the situation of Americans celebrating Christmas is also the most complex.
         Immigrants from all countries still follow the customs of their motherland.
         But at Christmas, Americans wear garlands outside their doors and other fancy decorations are the same.</p></div>

        <div><p>The average adult in France almost goes to church to attend midnight mass on Christmas Eve.
         After that, the family went to the home of the oldest married brother or sister to have dinner together. 
         This gathering discussed important family matters,
         but in case of family disharmony, and since then the former suspicions have been cleared up,
          everyone wants to be as good as ever,
         so Christmas is a kind day in France.</p></div>
